# Example goesproc configuration file for GOES-N series products.
#
# It includes both GOES-13 and GOES-15 handlers because they both
# relayed imagery from each other (until December 2017 when GOES-13
# was replaced by GOES-16).
#
# Their image product do not consistently cover the same area. For
# example, for full disk products, there is alternating padding on the
# left and right sides of the image. To produce images that cover the
# exact same area, we include the crop parameter for every handler, so
# that the images can be sequenced regardless of their excess area.
#
# The values for the crop parameters below were computed based off a
# large sample of LRIT files received from GOES-13 and GOES-15 in the
# second half of 2017 (both from the satellites directly and relays).
# Use `./src/lrit/areadump [DIR...] | sort | uniq -c` to reproduce.
#
# The following list is the number of images in that sample by the
# area they cover, grouped by their product:
